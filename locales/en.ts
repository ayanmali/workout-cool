            "Excellent question! The code will always remain free, but maintaining servers, database and infrastructure costs money. Your contribution helps us keep the tool free for everyone. It's a win-win model: you get premium features, the community keeps free access!",

          question: "Can I self-host Workout.cool?",

            "Absolutely! The entire codebase is available on GitHub under MIT license. You can deploy it on your own servers, customize it however you want, and use it completely free. Self-hosting gives you full control over your data and workout privacy.",

          question: "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
          answer:
            "Of course! No contracts, no commitments. Cancel with one click anytime. You'll keep access until your current billing period ends, and you can always restart later. Your workout data remains accessible even if you downgrade to free.",

          question: "Are there exercises for beginners?",

          question: "Can I import data from other apps?",
